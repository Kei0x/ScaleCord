# ScaleCord

## Introduction

Having problems running multiple electron apps on your 2004 ThinkPad running Arch?

Does loading Chromium when you just want to play Minecraft gives you anxiety?

> "Noooo you can't just take 100MiB for a basic app!!"


If so, fret not - ScaleCord is for you!

With this new revolutionary technology, you can run *two* or more electron applications in same time!
This means you can run Discord, Slack **and** VSCode without having to worry about a thing.

## How does it work?

By making use of Scaleway, Terraform and x11 forwarding, you can set a completely new server for your app. 
Endless possibilities await you!
